# The 100% Official Formula 1 game!
The goal of this project is to make a simple, 2d, top-down formula one game that runs on a browser. The game will be built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will be able to drive an open wheel race car around a track and record your times. Each lap, you will race a ghost that represents your fastest time.

In Bootleg F1, users will be able to:

1) Move the car with WASD
2) Race against their best time
3) Penalized (adding seconds to the time if they break rules)
4) Chose a car (maybe as simple as chosing the color, I am not sure yet)
5) Interact with a main menu (and possibly a difficulty setting if I get to making the ai).


In addition, this project will include:

Instructions on how to play, a readme, and a wireframe.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:

The project will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan on using the Canvas API, Webpack and the DOM to create the gameplay.

Implementation Timeline:
Friday Afternoon & Weekend:
Start the project. Set up a canvas and make the required classes. Have an object to move around an open space with keyboard input.

Monday:
Build a track and a car for the player to navigate.
Build a track map to sit in the top left that will show where the player is on the map.
Tuesday:
Build functionality for the stopwatch, scoreboard, and ghost (the player's best time).

Wednesday:
Build the main menu with the instructions and links.
Add features (additional cars/tracks, ai opponents, car damage, etc.) if there is time.

Thursday Morning:
Final touches and deploy the project. If I have time I will rewrite this readme.
