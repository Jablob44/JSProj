# Mini Hill Climb!
The goal of this project is to make a simple, 2d, top-down racing game that runs on a browser. You will be able to drive an open wheel race car up a short track and record your times. The game was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game view is a canvas element that is being redrawn on each frame.

In Mini Hill Climb, users will be able to:

1) Move the car with WASD
2) Race against their best time
4) Interact with a main menu
5) Interact with a pause menu
6) Interact with an "end-of-lap" menu.

In addition, this project will include:

Instructions on how to play, a readme, and a wireframe.

Wireframe:

*See the wireframe folder with images*

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:

The project will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan on using the Canvas API, Webpack and the DOM to create the gameplay.
I used DOM manipulation to grab the canvas HTML element. Everything displayed on the screen within the view of the game is painted onto the canvas with each frame.

How to play:

- Use W to move forward
- Use S to slow down/reverse
- Use A to turn left
- Use D to turn right

When you push any button on your keyboard, the game will start. Once you cross the finish line, your time will be recorded.

Future features:

- Fully functioning pause menu (with an unmute capability)
- The ability to return to the main menu
- General polishes to the game.

Implementation Timeline:
Friday Afternoon & Weekend:
Start the project. Set up a canvas and make the required classes. Have an object to move around an open space with keyboard input.

Monday:
Build a track and a car for the player to navigate.
Build a track map to sit in the top left that will show where the player is on the map.
Tuesday:
Build functionality for the stopwatch, scoreboard, and ghost (the player's best time).

Wednesday:
Build the main menu with the instructions and links.
Add features (additional cars/tracks, ai opponents, car damage, etc.) if there is time.

Thursday Morning:
Final touches and deploy the project. If I have time I will rewrite this readme.
